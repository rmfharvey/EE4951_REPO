Nimbelink Device is powered from 12V input.
A buck converter (TPS54229E) transforms the voltage from 12V to 4V at 60% to 90% efficiency.

All current shunt (voltage) measurements are given as voltages across a 0.1ohm resistor (1% tolerance) on the 4V rail.
Voltage measurements were given at the 4V rail.

These measurements were taken as the Nimbelink device was running the Skywire_Demo program in which it periodically
transmits data from the device over the internet to an online display on my laptop. I attached a text file which contains
the terminal window information from the Nimbelink device and I attached a screenshot from the online display.
